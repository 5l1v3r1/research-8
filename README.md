# Brutally Transparent Long Term Research Work 

### August 20th, 2018

This is the mark of my 2nd year in Montr√©al, Canada and my 4th year in North America. I didn't know I could survive this long but I did, time to celebrate it for more work on advanced research projects.

1. C++ 17 inference engine that supports Onnx
2. Source-to-Source (s2s) Automatic Differentiation JIT Compiler using the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure
3. Bitwyre Exchange Infrastructure
